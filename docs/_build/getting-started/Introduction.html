<p><em>msticpy</em> is a set of Python tools intended to be used for security
investigations and hunting. Many of the tools originated as code Jupyter
notebooks written to solve a problem as part of a security
investigation. Some of tools them are only useful in notebooks (e.g.
much of the nbtools sub-package) but many others can be used from any
Python program.</p>
<p>The package addresses three central needs for security investigators and
hunters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquiring and enriching data</li>
<li>Analyzing data</li>
<li>Visualizing data</li>
</ul>
<p>It is organized into three main sub-packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sectools</strong> - Python security tools to help with data enrichment,
analysis or investigation.</li>
<li><strong>nbtools</strong> - Jupyter-specific UI tools such as widgets, plotting
and other data display.</li>
<li><strong>data</strong> - data layer and pre-defined queries for Azure Sentinel,
MDATP and other data sources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Use-Cases-and-Environments">Use Cases and Environments<a class="anchor-link" href="#Use-Cases-and-Environments"> </a></h2><p>Although <em>msticpy</em> was originally developed for use with Azure Sentinel,
much of the package is agnostic to the data source. Data query
components are also supplied for Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat
Protection and Microsoft Security Graph.</p>
<p>The tool APIs typically accept a pandas DataFrame as input and, where
appropriate, return output as a DataFrame.</p>
