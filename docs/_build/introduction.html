<h1 id="MSTIC-Jupyter-and-Python-Security-Tools">MSTIC Jupyter and Python Security Tools<a class="anchor-link" href="#MSTIC-Jupyter-and-Python-Security-Tools"> </a></h1><p>The <strong>msticpy</strong> package was developed to support Jupyter Notebook
authoring for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/">Azure
Sentinel</a>.
Many of the components can also be used independently of Azure Sentinel
when using Jupyter for threat hunting and security investigation.</p>
<p>Most of the content of the package began life as inline code in a
notebook. However, having a lot of code in your notebooks creates a few
problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>notebooks dominated by big code blocks make it difficult to see the
results and text of your notebook - which is really what you want
your audience to see</li>
<li>it makes the notebook especially intimidating for non-programmers</li>
<li>it makes code re-use very hard.</li>
</ul>
<p>The philosophy behind this package is to create a repository for
re-usable pieces of functionality that make it both quicker to author
notebooks, and make resultant notebooks easier to read.</p>
<h2 id="What-is/who-are-MSTIC?">What is/who are MSTIC?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is/who-are-MSTIC?"> </a></h2><p>MSTIC stands for the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center - mainly
staffed by security engineers and analysts working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>authoring security detections for several Microsoft platforms</li>
<li>threat identification and investigation</li>
</ul>
